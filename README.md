Vampire Jumper can be played [here](https://jnadler-block.github.io/CMPM120-D3-VampireJumper/)  
Created by [Jackson Nadler-Block](https://github.com/JNadler-Block)

Gameplay/Experience requirements:
- The player can move their character left or right, but the sprite is bouncing, so the player needs to use physics mechanics that are out of their control (gravity and collision) to reach their goal.
- The platform locations are randomly generated, so depending on where they are placed, the player can increase their score just from the vampire continuously jumping (if platforms spawn directly above them).
- The game includes 3 physics based gameplay levels, and a game over and victory screen for each one.
